# AGENTS TODOs

This file lists tasks for SmugglerLib repository.

## Priority Items

1. Configure `log4net.config` so that file logs do not exceed **5MB**. When the file exceeds this size, logs should roll over using a pattern `fileName_N.log` (e.g., `fileName_1.log`, `fileName_2.log`).

## Additional Notes

- The repository currently contains no source code. Future tasks may involve establishing basic project structure and adding initial implementation.
